Sometimes, it feels hard to identify what I believe and what I do not believe. 

I am currently working on an article about how to address feminism in commercial advertisements. I believe femines are oppressed in patriarchial society, which is definitely something widespread throughout contemporary Internet. However, I found myself hard to write more on this topic. And, therefore, I discovered I did not buy everthing that such discourse covers.

I believe femines should share the same social status as musculines. However, in terms of maternity, I do not believe in any discourses that seek equality between femines and musculines. It is simply impossible. I find it hard for me to write down such phrases and, therefore, I do not believe in any such thing. Likewise, when folk feminism develops into the following discourse throughout Chinese SNS that "ah, that's the way males behave", I cannot buy them because they are not.

Say more and there is nothing more to say, which means there ends what I believe.
